  We will follow the
  <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>WCA Regulations</b></a>
  as much as possible for all events, while adapting where needed for an online format.
</div>

<h3>1) Eligibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Participants must register using their real name and valid contact details.</li>
  <li><b>One participant = one registration.</b> Duplicate entries may be removed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) Competition Login Credentials (Mandatory)</h3>

<div class="callout warning">
  <b>Important:</b> Each competition uses official Cubeology competition credentials. These credentials are compulsory for participation and verification.
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Credential Delivery:</b><br>
    The <b>Login ID and Password</b> for the specific competition will be sent to the <b>same email address used during registration/payment</b>.
    Participants must ensure this email is correct and accessible.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>One Credential Per Participant:</b><br>
    Each registered participant receives <b>one unique Login ID and Password</b> for that competition.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Same Credentials for All Events:</b><br>
    The <b>same Login ID and Password must be used for all events</b> that the participant is registered for in that competition.

      <li>Perform and record solves</li>
      <li>Submit times on the platform</li>
      <li>Submit video links for verification (per event)</li>
    </ul>
    Solves performed outside the official logged-in system may be considered <b>invalid</b>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Same ID/Password Required for Video Submission (Per Event):</b><br>
    The <b>same Login ID</b> used to compete must also be associated with your <b>video submission for each event</b>.
    Organizers may cross-check login data with submitted videos for verification.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>No Sharing of Credentials:</b><br>
    Login credentials are strictly personal. Sharing, transferring, or using another participant’s credentials may lead to:
    <ul>
      <li>Invalidation of solves</li>
      <li>Disqualification from the event/competition</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>

    If you do not receive or lose your credentials, you must contact organizers <b>before the competition starts</b>.
    Delays caused by missing login access are the participant’s responsibility.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3) Events & Format (Ao5)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Format for each event is Ao5 (Average of 5).</b></li>
  <li>You will perform <b>5 solves</b> per event.</li>
  <li>The average is computed according to standard cubing practice (fastest and slowest removed, average of remaining 3).</li>
  <li>Rankings are generated automatically by the platform.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4) Scrambles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scrambles are generated and displayed by the competition system.</li>
  <li>Each scramble must be used <b>only once</b> for its corresponding attempt.</li>
  <li>Using external scrambles or repeating a scramble is not allowed and may result in <b>DNF</b> for that attempt/event.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5) Inspection Time</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A maximum of <b>15 seconds inspection time</b> is allowed before each solve.</li>
  <li>Inspection violations may result in penalties as per standard cubing practice:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>+2 seconds</b> for minor inspection overrun</li>
    <li><b>DNF</b> for excessive inspection violation</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>6) Timer Mode (Recommended)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use the official Cubeology competition timer to record solves.</li>
  <li>The timer captures time automatically; manually editing timer-recorded times is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Any abnormal pattern of submissions may be reviewed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7) Typing Mode (Manual Entry)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Times must be entered in valid cubing formats, for example:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>12.34</b></li>

  </li>

  <li style="margin-top:10px;">
    <b>Clock Event:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>After completing the solve, <b>both sides of the clock must be clearly shown</b> on video.</li>
      <li>If video is required for the competition/event, the “both sides shown” requirement is mandatory.</li>
      <li>Failure to show both sides after the solve may result in <b>DNF</b> for that attempt/event.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>9) Video Recording (Mandatory)</h3>

<div class="callout warning">
  <b>Mandatory Rule:</b> Video recording is compulsory for all participants for all events and all solves.

</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Recording must start before your attempt begins</b> and must continue until the platform shows that your solves are submitted/recorded.
    This means the video should cover the full flow from <b>login / opening the timer page</b> to the <b>final “all solves submitted” screen</b>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>The video must clearly show ALL of the following at the same time:</b>
    <ul>

    <b>Scramble visibility is compulsory:</b> The scrambled state must be shown clearly before starting each solve.
    You must not hide the scramble view or switch camera angles in a way that breaks visibility.

    If you record the full session, it must remain continuous without any missing segments during solves.
  </li>
